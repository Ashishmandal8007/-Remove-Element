# -Remove-Element
# Approach
The code you provided is a Java implementation of the two-pointer approach to remove an element from an array. The function takes two arguments: the array to be modified and the element to be removed. It returns the new length of the array.

The function works by maintaining two pointers: i and j. The pointer i points to the next available position in the array, and the pointer j iterates over the array.

The function starts by initializing i to 0. Then, it enters a for loop that iterates over the array using the pointer j. For each element in the array, the function checks if it is equal to the element to be removed. If it is not, the function copies the element to the position pointed to by i and increments i.

Once the for loop terminates, the pointer i will point to the next available position in the array, and all of the elements before that position will be the elements that were not removed. The function then returns i, which is the new length of the array.

Here is an example of how the function would be used:

The function is efficient because it only needs to iterate over the array once. It also does not need to create a new array to store the elements that were not removed.
